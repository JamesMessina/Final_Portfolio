                    <p>I have a 4 year degree from Rutgers University in Business Economics. In my previous role as a performance measurement analyst, I worked with 10 wealth managers and financial advisors (from UBS and Wells Fargo) to process, review, and deliver investment performance reports for their end clients (of which I had about 100 total). Furthermore, in this role, I would utilize superior analytical and attention to detail skills to reconcile bank account transactions, review/upload historical financial data, and calculate risk metrics to ensure all data  (from our system) was in line with corresponding client bank statements. Communicating with UBS advisors and working collaboratively with other departments in our firm was a critical responsibility of my day to day duties. I exceeded at the ability to interpret a client's needs and revise his/her report in a timely manner all while multi-tasking (with other reports and projects) in an extremely fast-paced deadline-driven environment. Researching financial market news to verify trends in individual asset performance and price/classify securities was conducted on a daily basis.

                    Going back a little further in my work experience, I used to do payroll on Excel for one of my previous managers (Joe Parisi Construction). I also used to research product demographics, target market data, market assessments, and financial information while I was a marketing assistant at IFF.
                    
                    Currently, I own and operate my own math tutoring business from home where I increase student topic understanding in all math disciplines at all ages. I organize daily operations such as scheduling, finances, and client service. 
                    
                    Based on my current and previous work experience, educational background, and unique skill set, I know that I am the perfect candidate for this position.
